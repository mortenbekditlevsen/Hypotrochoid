# Hypotrochoid

This package contains a Hypotrochoid in the form of a SwiftUI `Shape`.

Initialized by number of 'teeth' in the outer gear and the number of 'teeth' in the inner gear plus an inset, which can be thought of as the distance from the inner gear circle to the 'hole' where the path is drawn from.
